[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/viglucci/framework-x.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/viglucci/framework-x)

A express.js powered framework that aims to promote 'best practices' through design practices such as re-use and inversion of control through Awilix.

Mostly just a experiment and a learning opportunity.

I wouldn't recommend you use this for your project, but feel free to browse the source.
